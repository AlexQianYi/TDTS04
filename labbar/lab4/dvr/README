Split Horizon:

     If B receives information from A, that updates B's route distances, but not route first hops, should we exclude A from the list of nodes to receive B's coming update?





     RouteEntry[] bestRouteto;
     RouteEntry minroute;


What happens:

     bestRouteto[i] = minroute; ???

Included in the <Net Ninny Proxy .tar.gz> (to be named):

* The source code: nin_proxy.cc
* Makefile. Compile with 'make ninnyproxy'.
* Run Net Ninny Proxy using the command:
      ninnyproxy <desired proxy port number to specify for browser>


### TESTING AND LIMITATIONS ###
Tests were done in three different environments (variables listed as <browser,
client network, proxy network>, where localhost means that the proxy was run on
the same machine as the browser):

1) Firefox, LiU, localhost
2) Firefox, ComHem, localhost
3) Firefox, ComHem, Bahnhof
4)

The tests (a-d) tests basic functionality with text/HTML/url filtering, tests
(e-h) aim to test average functionality on a set of commonly used sites. Test (i)
is aimed specifically to test googling of the blacklisted words, (j) to test
streaming video functionality and (k) to test enforced https.

## NETNINNY CAPABILITIES ##

The proxy only handles HTTP requests. The proxy filters URL and plain uncom-
pressed text content for certain keywords. In current state (probably because of
child session limitation of 8M-sized buffer), the proxy does not handle video
streaming over HTTP. The proxy only filters content based on transmission from
server to client. A modified-since request that is redirected to a cache will
only filter if the cache is not local and uses HTTP communication. The proxy
allows for the host to reuse the bound port upon process termination.

"What to Deliver: Finally, please list, summarize, and discuss how your proxy handle different website types, including both streaming and non-streaming websites that use (or not use) HTTPS and gzip, for example. (Include example websites here.)"
